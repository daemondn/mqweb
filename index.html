 <h1>Welcome to MQWeb</h1>
 <p>
  Make it possible to Administrate your Websphere MQ environment with your 
  favorite browser. That's the ultimate goal of MQWeb. You can use the built-in 
  web pages, but you can use any programming language that supports HTTP and 
  JSON to write your own application.

 <h2>HTTP Daemon</h2>

  The core of MQWeb is an HTTP daemon written in C++ using the 
  <a href="http://www.pocoproject.org">POCO</a> project. Based on the URI, the
  daemon will return WebSphere MQ information in HTML format or as JSON objects.
