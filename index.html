 <h1>Welcome to MQWeb</h1>
 <blockquote><p>Warning! This website is still a work in progress ...</p></blockquote>
 <p>
  Administrating your Websphere MQ environment using your favorite browser.
  That's the ultimate goal of MQWeb. You can use the build-in web pages, but you
  can also write your own web pages with any server-side language and only
  use the JSON objects that are returned by the MQWeb daemon.
 </p>
 <h2>HTTP Daemon</h2>
 <p>
  The core of MQWeb is an HTTP daemon written in C++ using the 
  <a href="http://www.pocoproject.org">POCO</a> project. Based on the URI, the
  daemon will return WebSphere MQ information in HTML format or as JSON objects.

    websites.
