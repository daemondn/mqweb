  Administrating your Websphere MQ environment using your favorite browser.
  That's the purpose of MQWeb. You can use the build-in web pages, but you
  can also write your own web pages with any server-side language and only
  use the JSON objects that are returned by the MQWeb daemon.

  <a href="http://www.pocoproject.org">POCO</a> project. Based on the URI, the
  daemon will return HTML or JSON. Read more on which
