The operator that is being used to evaluate whether the parameter satisfies the filter-value.
The default is `EQ`.

The following values are allowed:

+ `GT` : Greater than
+ `LT` : Less than
+ `EQ` : Equal to

+ `NLT` : Not less than
+ `NGT` : Not greater than

A Stringfilter can use some additional operators:

+ `CTG` : Contains an item which matches a generic string
+ `EXG` : Does not contain any item which matches a generic string.
